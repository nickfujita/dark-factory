# Notes verification map

This directory is the maintained source for verifying the user-facing behavior of Notes. Read the index before driving the app, then use the matching feature file as the recipe.

## Baseline preconditions

- Launch Notes at `http://127.0.0.1:4173` with a disposable data directory.
- Set `NOTES_DATA_DIR=/tmp/notes-verify-$RUN_ID` so concurrent runs do not share state.
- Seed notes titled `Quarterly plan` and `Grocery list`.
- Put the `notes` CLI on `PATH`.
- Run the doctor check, `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4173/api/health`, and require the expected data directory and build revision in its reply.
- Never drive an instance that was not started by this verification run.

## Driving conventions

- Start every recipe from the baseline state unless its preconditions say otherwise.
- Prefer ARIA roles and accessible names over CSS selectors or DOM position.
- Treat every command as literal. Keep quoted names and flags unchanged.
- Run browser actions through `agent-browser --session notes-verify`, so the run never collides with another session's browser.
- Run terminal actions as plain shell commands, capturing stdout, stderr, and the exit code.
- Restore seeded data after a mutation. Do not remove proof artifacts during cleanup.

## Proof and skip reporting

- Capture the user action and the resulting state, not only the final screen.
- UI proof includes an `agent-browser snapshot` capture and a screenshot with the app identity visible.
- CLI proof includes the command, stdout, stderr, and exit code.
- Mutation proof includes a read-only second view of the stored value.
- Record the feature ID and entry point used with every artifact.
- Report an unreachable path with the attempted command and the unmet precondition.
- Do not report a skipped entry point as verified through a different path.

## Feature entry contract

Each feature file starts with an H1 title and one paragraph describing the user-visible behavior. When the project manifest names a catalog, a `Catalog IDs:` line follows that paragraph naming the catalog entries the file covers. Notes has no catalog, so the files here carry none. The file then uses exactly four H2 sections in this order.

1. `Sub-features` lists short IDs with one line for each behavior.
2. `How to get to it (user POV)` lists every user entry point.
3. `Driving it with <harness>` starts with `Preconditions:` and uses labeled bullets that pair each user action with an exact command and observable result.
4. `Gotchas` lists traps that can waste or invalidate a verification run.

Keep implementation details out of the map. Name only user paths, stable handles, required state, commands, and observable proof.

## Features

- [Create a note](./create-note.md) covers browser and CLI creation, cancellation, persistence, and cleanup.
- [Search notes](./search.md) covers toolbar, keyboard, and CLI search with matching, empty, and clear states.
