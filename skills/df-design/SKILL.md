# df-design

Design before implementing. Sketch types, function signatures, class shapes, and module boundaries with `not implemented` bodies and pseudocode. Synthesize across independent runner candidates, then fill in code against the chosen sketch. If implementation proves the sketch wrong, throw it out and redesign.

Principle names in this skill cite `../df/references/principles.md`.

## Input

The input is the settled requirements. In the Standard and High-consequence lanes that is the PRD, hardened by the challenge round. In a Quick-lane escalation it is the recorded finish predicate. Do not start a sketch from an unsettled ask. A requirements question goes back to the requirements step, not into the design.

## Start

Open a todo list with one entry per phase before starting. The list shows phase position and keeps phases from silently disappearing.

1. Ground
2. Sketch
3. Agree
4. Implement
5. Scrap

## Phase A: Ground the problem

Build a real mental model of every system the new code touches. Run the **how** skill over the relevant subsystems. Critique mode if existing structure is the constraint or the design must push back on it.

Naming a file isn't grounding. Produce the traced model `how` prescribes. If the design redefines ownership or layering, also run the **why** skill on the existing shape so the rationale becomes a constraint, not a guess.

Skip Phase A only when the work is genuinely greenfield with no surrounding system to integrate.

## Phase B: Sketch

Spawn candidate runners with the Agent tool. Resolve them through the `design_runners` role in `../df/references/model-policy.md`, never a hardcoded model slug. The Standard lane runs one runner. The High-consequence lane runs two. Pass `references/runner-prompt.md` as each runner's prompt, with the requirements and the Phase A grounding artifacts as file pointers. Each candidate is a design package shaped per `references/rationale-template.md`: the caller's usage written first, then the type sketch, function signatures, module map, and prose rationale derived from it.

Design it twice. Require at least two structurally distinct candidates before synthesis, even when the first looks sufficient. This is the exhaust-the-design-space principle made concrete. Whole-shape alternatives, not point fixes inside one shape. With one runner, the runner produces both candidates. With two runners, each produces its best, and when they converge on the same shape, ask one for a genuine alternative before synthesizing.

Screen every candidate against [`references/design-red-flags.md`](references/design-red-flags.md) before synthesis. Reject or revise shallow modules, information leakage, temporal decomposition, and pass-through methods.

Compare viable candidates on interface depth. Prefer the design that hides more complexity behind a smaller, simpler public surface. A rich interface can keep call chains short by concentrating capability instead of scattering it across layers.

You synthesize. Pick a base candidate, graft what the others did better, reject the rest with reasons, and record the choice in the rationale's "Synthesis decision" section.

## Phase C: Agree, lane-aware

The checkpoint follows the lane. It is not opt-in.

- **Standard.** No separate pause here. The synthesized design ships with the plan, and the operator signs off on both together at the df-plan sign-off. df-plan is pending port. Until it lands, surface the design with whatever plan the lane produces and get one combined sign-off.
- **High-consequence.** Explicit checkpoint. Surface the synthesized design and pause for operator sign-off before any implementation.
- **Quick escalation.** Surface the sketch in the thread and continue. The recorded finish predicate stays the acceptance.

There is no one-way ratchet onto the heavier path. When grounding or the sketch shows the ask is smaller than the lane assumed, say so and propose de-escalation. The operator confirms lane changes in both directions. Nothing escalates itself silently, and review findings never change the lane.

The synthesis can ship as its own commit in any lane. That is the scaffold-first mode of the foundational-thinking principle; subsequent commits read as filling in bodies against a stable contract. Planned and scoped breakage during fill-in is fine, per outcome-oriented-execution. For adversarial pressure on the design before implementing, run the **interrogate** skill on the synthesized sketch.

If the operator pushes back on the shape, at a checkpoint or after the fact, treat that as Phase A evidence. Re-ground and re-run Phase B before writing more code.

## Phase D: Implement against the sketch

Replace `not implemented` bodies with code, pseudocode with logic. The synthesized sketch is the contract.

Deviations from the sketch are signal worth surfacing, not friction to absorb silently. If a function needs a parameter the sketch didn't anticipate, ask whether the sketch was wrong, the requirement was missed, or the implementation is overreaching. Surface it; don't bolt it on.

## Phase E: Scrap when the architecture is wrong

If implementation keeps producing friction the sketch can't absorb, throw the sketch out. Don't bolt fixes onto a wrong design, per the redesign-from-first-principles and fix-root-causes principles.

The signal is a *pattern*, not single instances. Tells:

- The same shape of workaround appearing repeatedly across unrelated code.
- Multiple unrelated edge cases that all need special-case branches.
- Types that need escape hatches (`any`, casts, optional fields always set in practice) to compile.
- The "we need a lock" reflex when the sketch said the state wasn't shared.
- Callers having to know the abstraction's internal rules to use it.
- Two or more independent Phase D deviations of the same shape across the implementation. Surfacing deviations is Phase D's job; a repeated pattern of them is Phase E's trigger.

Use judgment. A few edge cases don't condemn an architecture. Some problems are legitimately complex; complexity in the data is not complexity in the design. The rewrite signal is repeated friction of the same shape, not single hard cases.

When you scrap:

1. Re-run the **how** skill over what's been built. The implementation lessons enter the new design as inputs, not vibes.
2. Redesign as if the new constraints had been day-one assumptions, per redesign-from-first-principles.
3. Subtract before adding, per the subtract-before-you-add principle. The new sketch should be smaller than the old one before it grows.
4. Return to Phase B and re-run the runners.

## Outputs

The caller's usage is written first and the type sketch derived from it. One file with new types and signatures for small changes; module map plus type definitions for larger work. The rationale ships alongside, shaped per `references/rationale-template.md`, including the usage sketch and the synthesis decision.
